POEM = """Meet Zora Chi. She's eight years old \n
and has a heart of solid gold. \n
For a girl her age, she is very bright, \n
But many do not realize her plight.\n
Zora isn't like the other kids.\n
She sees the world in nothing but grids. \n
In her imaginary world, Networks are all around.\n
She sees them in her home, school, and all over town!\n
Her teachers call her tormented,\n
The children think her demented.\n
For few understand the magnitude of her design:\n
An invention so profound it was considered a crime.\n
She controls computer networks in her notebook.\n
She told no one except the school's cook.\n
LAN, WAN, SAN! she exclaims.\n
The cook is baffled by these names.\n
One day at school, in the middle of class,\n
Zora breaks Mr. Winely's favorite glass.\n
No more recess for you! Mr. Winely swore.\n
Now, this was a thought that Zora abhorred!\n
Mr. Winely sends her out of the room -\n
Even he could not foretell the impending doom.\n
For her revenge Zora constructs a plan,\n
While the other kids read books like Frank'n'Stan.\n
She scribbles and scrabbles while the teacher babbles...\n
Then takes out her special notebook and pen.\n
She vows the school will never have a computer network again!"""
